## 🎯 **Step 3: WHERE TO PASTE SCREENSHOTS** 

### **I'll tell you when to do this step!**

**For 16.0 Branch:**
```bash
# Navigate to:
/home/sabry3/automatic_error_reporter/error_reporter_enterprise/static/description/

# Replace these files:
dashboard_overview.png  ← Paste your Screenshot 1 here
error_details.png      ← Paste your Screenshot 2 here  
team_analytics.png     ← Paste your Screenshot 3 here
```

**For 17.0 Branch:**
```bash
# Same files, same location, but in 17.0 branch
```

**For 18.0 Branch:**
```bash
# Same files, same location, but in 18.0 branch
```

## ✅ **Step 4: Verification Checklist**

After pasting screenshots:
- [ ] All 3 screenshots are 800x600 pixels

- [ ] Screenshots show real Odoo interface (not placeholders)
- [ ] Text in screenshots is readable
- [ ] Screenshots demonstrate key module features
- [ ] All 3 branches have the same screenshots

## 🚀 **Step 5: I'll Handle the Rest**

After you paste the screenshots, I'll:
1. ✅ Commit changes to all branches
2. ✅ Push to GitHub
3. ✅ Update GitHub Pages with screenshot gallery
4. ✅ Test Odoo Apps Store compatibility
5. ✅ Verify all images load properly

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Great Screenshots:**

1. **Use Demo Data:** Create realistic test errors, don't use Lorem Ipsum
2. **Clean Interface:** Hide any personal information or irrelevant UI elements
3. **Good Lighting:** Ensure screenshots are bright and clear
4. **Consistent Style:** Use the same Odoo theme/styling across all screenshots
5. **Show Value:** Each screenshot should demonstrate a key benefit of your module
